# Three Body Problem Simulation

This Python application uses the Panda3D game engine to simulate the three-body problem in celestial mechanics. It provides an interactive visualization where users can control the simulation by starting, pausing, and adding an additional planet.

## Features

- **Start/Restart/Pause Simulation:** Control the flow of the simulation with UI buttons.
- **Add Trisolaris:** Introduce a fourth body into the simulation dynamically.
- **Interactive UI:** Manage the simulation via an easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Visual Trails:** Observe the trajectory of celestial bodies with colorful trails.
- **Background Music:** Experience an immersive auditory backdrop that enhances the visual simulation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Panda3D
- NumPy

You can install Panda3D and NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install panda3d numpy
```

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code:

```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the main Python script:

```bash
python three_body_sim.py
```

## Controls

- **Start Button:** Begins the simulation.
- **Restart Button:** Resets and restarts the simulation from the beginning.
- **Pause/Resume Button:** Pauses the ongoing simulation or resumes a paused simulation.
- **Add Trisolaris Button:** Adds a fourth body, "Trisolaris," to the simulation.

## Configuration

Modify the `three_body_sim.py` to change initial conditions or to tweak physical parameters like masses and velocities of the celestial bodies.
